I check the nmap, there we can find on port 80 nginx 1.18.0 :P i hope we can do something with it.
2. Which software is listening on port 3000? (Do not include the "." in the name.)
Still we can use as nmap scan, we can see there Node.js but the want answer without . it is just nodejs
3. The source code for the site includes which folder that is ascosiated with repositories?
First what we need to do is download Source code from website
